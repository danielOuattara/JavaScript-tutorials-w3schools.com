  <h1>JSON Introduction.</h1><hr/>


<!-- JSON: JavaScript Object Notation.
=======================================

JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data.
JSON is text, written with JavaScript object notation.


Exchanging Data
================

When exchanging data between a Browser and a Server, the data can only be text.

JSON is text, and we can convert any JavaScript 'object' into 'JSON',
and send  that JSON to the server.

We can also convert any JSON received from the server into JavaScript objects.

This way we can work with the data as JavaScript objects, with no complicated
parsing and translations.

 Browser: JavaScrit Object <====> JSON: Server


Sending Data
=============

If you have data stored in a JavaScript object, you can convert the object into
JSON, and send it to a server:

You will learn more about the 'JSON.stringify()' function later in this tutorial. -->

    <h2> From JavaScrit object to JSON</h2>

    <p id="demo1"></p>

    <script>
      var myObj = {name: "John", age: 31, city: "New-York"};
      var myJSON = JSON.stringify(myObj);
      document.getElementById('demo1').innerHTML = "myJSON = " + myJSON;

      // window.location = "demo_json.php?x=" + myJSON
      // console.log(myJSON);
      // console.log('typeof myJSON = ' + typeof myJSON);
    </script>


<!-- Receiving Data
====================

If you receive data in JSON format, you can convert it into a JavaScript object.
 You will learn more about the 'JSON.parse()' function later in this tutorial.-->
    <p id="demo2"></p>

    <script>
      var myJSON2 = '{ "name": "Anna Smith", "age": 25, "city": "New-York"}';
      var myObj2 = JSON.parse(myJSON2);
      document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML =  myObj2.name;
    </script>


<!-- Storing Data
==================
When storing data, the data has to be a certain format, and regardless of where
you choose to store it, text is always one of the legal formats.

JSON makes it possible to store JavaScript objects as text. -->

    <p id="demo3"></p>

    <script>

      // Storing data:
      myObj3 = {name: "Roberto Carlos", age : 48, city: "Sao Poalo"};
      myJSON3 = JSON.stringify(myObj3);
      localStorage.setItem("testJSON", myJSON3);

      // Extracting/ Receiving data:
      text = localStorage.getItem ("testJSON");
      obj3 = JSON.parse(text);
      document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = obj3.name;

    </script>


<!--What is JSON?
==================
  > JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
  > JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format
  > JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand
  > JSON is language independent *

NOTE: * JSON uses JavaScript syntax, but the JSON format is text only.
      Text can be read and used as a data format by any programming language.

The JSON format was originally specified by Douglas Crockford.


Why use JSON?
=============
Since the JSON format is text only, it can easily be sent to and from a server,
and used as a data format by any programming language.

JavaScript has a built in function to convert a string, written in JSON format,
into native JavaScript objects: 'JSON.parse()'

So, if you receive data from a server, in JSON format, you can use it like any
other JavaScript object.  -->
