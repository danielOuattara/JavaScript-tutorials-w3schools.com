        <h1>Ajax - The XMLHttpRequest Object.</h1><hr/>


<!-- The keystone of AJAX is the "XMLHttpRequest" object.


The XMLHttpRequest Object
=========================

All modern browsers support the 'XMLHttpRequest' object.

The 'XMLHttpRequest' object can be used to exchange data with a web server
behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web
page, without reloading the whole page.


Create an XMLHttpRequest Object
================================

All modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, IE7+, Edge, Safari, Opera) have a
built-in 'XMLHttpRequest' object.


Syntax for creating an XMLHttpRequest object:

____________________________________________
var variable_name = new XMLHttpRequest();                                -->


  <script>

    // option 1 :------------------------------------------------------------
    function loadDoc() {
      var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
      xhttp.open("GET", "ajax_info.txt", true);
      xhttp.send();
      xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
        if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
              document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = this.responseText;
            }
        };
    }


    // option 2 :--------------------------------------------------------------
    const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open("GET", "url", true);
    xhr.send();
    xhr.onreadystatechange = () => {
      if (this.readyState == XMLHttpRequest.DONE && this.status == 200) {
        reponse =  JSON.parse(this.responseText);
      } 
    }
  </script>



<!--Access Across Domains
==========================

For security reasons, modern browsers do not allow access across domains.

This means that both 'the web page' and 'the XML file' that the browser tries
to load, must be located on the same server.

All the examples on w3Schools open XML files located on the W3Schools domain.

If you want to use the example above on one of your own web pages, the XML
files you load must be located on your own server.


Older Browsers (IE5 and IE6)
=============================

Old versions of Internet Explorer (5/6) use an 'ActiveX' object instead of
the 'XMLHttpRequest' object:

var variable_name = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");

To handle IE5 and IE6, check if the browser supports the XMLHttpRequest
object, otherwise, create an ActiveX object:                                -->

        <script>
           function loadDoc() {

             var xhttp;
             if (window.XMLHtppRequest) {
               xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
             } else {
               xhttp = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
             }

             xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
               if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
                 document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = this.responseText;
               }
             };

             xhttp.open("GET", "ajax_info.txt", true);
             xhttp.send();
           }
         </script>

HTTP Status Messages
====================

HTML Error Messages
-------------------

When a browser requests a service from a web server, an error might occur,
and the server might return an error code like "404 Not Found".
It is common to name these errors 'HTML error messages'.

But these messages are something called 'HTTP status messages'. In fact, the
server always returns a message for every request. The most common message
is 200 OK.

Below is a list of HTTP status messages that might be returned:


1xx: Information
==================
Message:                  Description:
--------                  ------------

100 Continue 	            The server has received the request headers, and
                          the client should proceed to send the request body

101 Switching Protocols 	The requester has asked the server to switch protocols

103 Checkpoint 	          Used in the resumable requests proposal to resume
                          aborted PUT or POST requests

2xx: Successful
================
Message:               Description:
---------              ------------

200 OK 	               The request is OK (this is the standard response for
                       successful HTTP requests)

                       created

    Information        returning information that may be from another source

204 No Content 	       The request has been successfully processed, but is not
                       returning any content

205 Reset Content 	   The request has been successfully processed, but is not
                       returning any content, and requires that the requester
                       reset the document view

206 Partial Content 	The server is delivering only part of the resource due
                      to a range header sent by the client

3xx: Redirection
=================

Message:             	Description:
