      <div id="div01" >
          <h2 id="head01" onmouseover="this.innerHTML = 'Thank You !'"
              onmouseout="this.innerHTML = 'Mouse Over Me'">Mouse over me</h2>


          <h2 id="head02" onmouseover="this.style.cursor='pointer'" 
              onclick="clickMeEvent(this)">Click Me</h2>
      </div>

      <script>
          function clickMeEvent(obj) {
                if (obj.innerHTML == "Click Me") {
                    obj.innerHTML = "Click Me <br> Click Me Again";
                    return;
                }
                if (obj.innerHTML == "Click Me <br> Click Me Again") {
                    obj.innerHTML = "Thank You";  
                    return; 
                }
                if (obj.innerHTML == "Thank You") {
                obj.innerHTML = "Goodbye";  
                    return; 
                }
                if (obj.innerHTML == "Goodbye") {
                    obj.style.display = "none";
                    return;
                }
            }

      </script>
    


<!--Reacting to Events
======================

A JavaScript code can be executed when an event occurs, like when
a user clicks on an HTML element.

To execute code when a user clicks on an element, add JavaScript
code to an HTML event attribute like : onclick=JavaScript

Examples of HTML events:

    > When a user clicks the mouse
    > When a web page has loaded
    > When an image has been loaded
    > When the mouse moves over an element
    > When an input field is changed
    > When an HTML form is submitted
    > When a user strokes a key                                           -->


<!-- Example 1: The content of the <h1> element is changed when
                a user clicks on it: -->


    <h2 onclick="this.innerHTML='Hello World !'" 
        onmouseover ="style.cursor= 'pointer'">Click on me !</h2>


<!-- Example 2: A function is called from the event handler: -->

    <h2 onclick="changeText(this)">Click me !</h2>
    <script>
        function changeText(id) {
            id.innerHTML = "Hello world !";
        }
    </script>


<!-- HTML Event Attributes
===========================

To assign events to HTML elements you can use event attributes

Assign an onclick event to a button element.
A function named 'displayDate()' will be executed
when the button is clicked.-->

    <button onclick = "displayDate(this)"> what Date are we ? Click to know !</button><br/><br/>

    <button onclick = "displayDate2()"> Date ? Click to know !</button><br/><br/>

    <p id="demo1"></p>
    
    <button onclick = "this.innerHTML = new Date()">Date ?</button><br/><br/>

    <script>
        function displayDate(elem) {
            var today = new Date();
            elem.innerHTML = today;
        }
        function displayDate2() {
            document.getElementById('demo1').innerHTML = new Date();
        }
    </script>


<!-- Assign Events Using the HTML DOM
======================================

The HTML DOM allows you to assign events to HTML elements using 
JavaScript:  -->

    <p>Click "Try it" to execute the displayDate() function.</p>

    <button id="myButton">Button 3</button>

    <p id="demo2"></p>

    <script>
        document.getElementById("myButton").onclick = displayDate3;

        function displayDate3() {
            document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = Date();
        }
    </script>

<!-- In the example above, a function named 'displayDate3' is assigned 
to an HTML element with the id="myBtn".
The function will be executed when the button is clicked.


The onload and onunload Events
==============================

The 'onload' and 'onunload' events are triggered when the user enters or 
leaves the page.

The 'onload' event can be used to check the visitor's browser type and 
browser version, and load the proper version of the web page based on 
the information.

The 'onload' and 'onunload' events can be used to deal with cookies.   -->


      <p id="demo3"></p>
      <script>
          function checkCookies() {
              var text ="";
              if (navigator.cookieEnabled == true ) {
                  text = "Cookies are enabled";
                  
              } else {
                  text = "Cookies are not enabled ";
              }

              document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = text;
          }
      </script>


<!-- The onchange Event
========================

The 'onchange' event is often used in combination with validation of 
input fields.
Below is an example of how to use the onchange. The 'upperCase()' 
function will be called when a user changes the content of an input field. -->


         Type in: <input type="text" id="fname" placeholder="your full name ..."
           onchange="myFunction1()">
        <button id="button3">Click to reload</button>
        <script>

            var x = document.getElementById("fname");
        
            function myFunction1() {    
                 return x.value = x.value.toUpperCase();
            }

            document.getElementById("button3").onclick = inputEmpty;

            function inputEmpty() {
               return x.value = "";
                
            }
        </script>


<!-- The onmouseover and onmouseout Events
============================================

The 'onmouseover' and 'onmouseout' events can be used to trigger a 
function when the user mouses over, or out of, an HTML element: -->

       <div id ></div>






<!-- HTML DOM Events
=====================

HTML DOM events allow JavaScript to register different event handlers 
on elements in an HTML document.

Events are normally used in combination with functions, and the function
will not be executed before the event occurs (such as when a user clicks a button).
