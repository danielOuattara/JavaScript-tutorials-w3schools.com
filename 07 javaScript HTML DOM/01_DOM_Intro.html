<!--With the HTML DOM, JavaScript can access and change anything on the
HTML document.


The HTML DOM (Document Object Model).
=====================================

When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of
that page. The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects:           -->

<img src="htmltreeDOM.gif" alt="HTML Tree DOM" style="height:400px; width:600px;">

<!-- With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create
dynamic HTML:

JavaScript can :
----------------
  > find / change / add / remove all the HTML elements, HTML attributes,
     and CSS styles in the page.

  > creates HTML events /react to all existing HTML events in the page.

  > change the content of HTML elements
  > change the CSS style of HTML elements
  > react to HTML DOM events
  > add and delete HTML elements


 What is the DOM ?
===================

The 'DOM' is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.

The 'DOM' defines a standard for accessing documents: "the W3C Document
Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that
allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content,
structure, and style of a document."

The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:

    > Core DOM - standard model for all document types
    > XML DOM  - standard model for XML documents
    > HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents


What is the HTML DOM ?
======================

The 'HTML DOM' is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML.
It defines:
    > The HTML elements as objects
    > The properties of all HTML elements
    > The methods to access all HTML elements
    > The events for all HTML elements

In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add,
or delete HTML elements.  -->
