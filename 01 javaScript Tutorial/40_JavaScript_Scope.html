        <h1>JavaScript Scope</h1>


<!-- In JavaScript there are two types of scope:

    > Local scope
    > Global scope

JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope.

Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of these variables.

Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function. -->


<!-- Local JavaScript Variables
===============================
Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.
Local variables have Function scope: They can only be accessed from within the
function.

Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with
the same name can be used in different functions.

Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the
function is completed. -->
       <script>

            // code here can NOT use carName

            function myFunction() {
              var carName = "Volvo";

              // code here CAN use carName

            }
        </script>

<!-- Global JavaScript Variables
================================
A variable declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAL.
A global variable has global scope: All scripts and functions on a web page can
access it.  -->


        <script>

            var carName = "Volvo";

            // code here can use carName

            function myFunction() {

              // code here can also use carName

            }

        </script>

<!-- JavaScript Variables
=========================
In JavaScript, objects and functions are also variables.

Scope determines the accessibility of variables, objects, and functions from
different parts of the code. -->




<!-- Automatically Global
==========================
If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared,
it will automatically become a GLOBAL variable. -->
        <script>
            myFunction();

            // code here can use carName

            function myFunction() {
              carName = "Volvo";  // carName initialized before declared
          }                       // become Global variable.

        </script>

<!-- Strict Mode
=================
All modern browsers support running JavaScript in "Strict Mode".
In "Strict Mode", undeclared variables are not automatically global.        -->


<!-- Global Variables in HTML
=============================
With JavaScript, the global scope is the complete JavaScript environment.
In HTML, the global scope is the window object. All global variables belong
to the window object. -->

        <script>
            var carName = "Volvo";

            // code here can use window.carName

        </script>

<!-- WARNING
============
Do NOT create global variables unless you intend to.

Your global variables (or functions) can overwrite window variables
(or functions). Any function, including the window object, can overwrite
 your global variables and functions.                                        -->

<!-- The Lifetime of JavaScript Variables
==========================================
The lifetime of a JavaScript variable starts when it is declared.
Local variables are deleted when the function is completed.
In a web browser, global variables are deleted when you close the browser
window (or tab).                                                             -->

<!--Function Arguments
=======================
Function arguments (parameters) work as local variables inside functions.    -->
