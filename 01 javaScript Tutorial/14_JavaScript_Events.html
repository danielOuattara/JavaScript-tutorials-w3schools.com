      <h1>JavaScript Events</h1>

<!-- 'HTML events' are "things" that happen to HTML elements.
     When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can
     "react" on these events.

 HTML Events
==============
An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.
Here are some examples of HTML events:
 > An HTML web page has finished loading
 > An HTML input field was changed
 > An HTML button was clicked

   <element event='some JavaScript'>
   or
   <element event="some JavaScript">

   example:
   °  <button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML =
             Date()">The time is?</button>

   ° <button onclick="this.innerHTML = Date()">The time is?</button>

   Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.
   JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.
   HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to
   HTML elements.                                                          -->

       <p id="demo1">Examples</p>

       <button  style='margin: 10px 0;'type="button" onclick=
       "document.getElementById('demo1').innerHTML = Date()">Time is :</button><br/>

       <button type="button" onclick="this.innerHTML = Date()">Time is (this):</button>

       <p id="demo2"></p>
       <button type="button" onclick="myDisplayDate()">Date ?</button>
       <script>
        /*   function myDisplayDate() {
               document.getElementById('demo2').innerHTML = Date();
            }
        */
           myDisplayDate = () => document.getElementById('demo2').innerHTML = Date();
       </script>


<!-- Common HTML Events
========================
Here is a list of some common HTML events:

Event 	      Description
-------       ------------
onchange 	  An HTML element has been changed
onclick 	  click an HTML element
onmouseover   move the mouse over an HTML element
onmouseout 	  move the mouse away from an HTML element
onkeydown 	  push a keyboard key
onload    	  the browser has finished loading the page

The list is much longer: W3Schools JavaScript Reference HTML DOM Events.     -->

<!-- What can JavaScript Do?
=============================

Event handlers can be used to handle, and verify, user input, user actions,
and browser actions:

 > Things that should be done every time a page loads
 > Things that should be done when the page is closed
 > Action that should be performed when a user clicks a button
 > Content that should be verified when a user inputs data
 > And more ...

Many different methods can be used to let JavaScript work with events:

 > HTML event attributes can execute JavaScript code directly
 > HTML event attributes can call JavaScript functions
 > You can assign your own event handler functions to HTML elements
 > You can prevent events from being sent or being handled
 > And more ...

You will learn a lot more about events and event handlers in the HTML DOM chapters.
