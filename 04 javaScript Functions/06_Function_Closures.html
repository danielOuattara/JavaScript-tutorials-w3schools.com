/*
JavaScript variables can belong to the 'local' or 'global' scope.

Global variables can be made local (private) with 'closures' .

A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after
the parent function has closed. */


/* Global Variables.
====================

A 'function' can access all variables defined 'inside' the function : */

            function myFunction() {
                var a = 4;
                return a * a;  // 16
            }
/*
But a function can also access variables defined outside the function: */

            var a = 4;  //
            function myFunction2() {
                return a * a ;  // 16
            }

/*
In the last example, 'a' is a 'global variable'.
In a web page, global variables belong to the 'window' object. They can be used
(and changed) by all scripts in the page (and in the window).

In the first example, 'a' is a 'local variable'. It can only be used inside
the function where it is defined. It is hidden from other functions and other
scripting code.

Global and local variables with the same name are different variables.
Modifying one, does not modify the other.

Note: Variables created without a declaration keyword (var, let, or const) 
      are always global, even if they are created inside a function. */


/* Variable Lifetime.
=====================

> Global variables live until the page is discarded, like when you navigate
to another page or close the window.

> Local variables have short lives. They are created when the function is
invoked, and deleted when the function is finished. */


/* A Counter Dilemma.
=====================

Suppose you want to use a variable for counting something, and you want
this counter to be available to all functions.

You could use a global variable, and a function to increase the counter: */

            // initial Counter
            var counter = 0;

            // function incrementing
            function add() {
                counter +=1;
            }

            add();
            add();
            add();  // from here, counter = 3

/*
There is a problem with the solution above: Any code on the page can change
the counter, without calling add().

The counter should be local to the add() function, to prevent other code from
changing it: */

            var counter = 0;

            function add() {
                var counter = 0;
                counter += 1;
            }

            add();
            add();
            add();  // from here, counter = 0

/*
It did not work because we display the global counter instead of the local counter.
We can remove the global counter and access the local counter by
letting the function return it: */


            // Function to increment counter
            function add() {
            var counter = 0;
            counter += 1;
            return counter;
            }

            // Call add() 3 times
            add();
            add();
            add();

            //The counter should now be 3. But it is 1.

/*
It did not work because we reset the local counter every time we call the function.

A JavaScript inner function can solve this. */


/* JavaScript Nested Functions.
===============================

All functions have access to the global scope.
In fact, in JavaScript, all functions have access to the scope "above" them.
JavaScript supports nested functions. Nested functions have access to the scope
"above" them.

In this example, the inner function 'plus()' has access to the 'counter' variable
in the parent function: */

            function add() {
                var counter = 0;
                function plus() {
                    counter += 1;
                }
                plus();
                plus();
                plus();
                return counter;
            }

/*
This could have solved the counter dilemma, if we could reach the 'plus()'
function from the outside.
We also need to find a way to execute counter = 0 only once.
We need a closure. */


/* JavaScript Closures.
=======================

Remember self-invoking functions ? What does this function do ? */

        var add = ( function () {
            var counter = 0;
            return function () { counter +=1; return counter }
        }) ();
        add();
        add();
        add();

/* Last Example Explained.
==========================

The variable 'add' is assigned the return value of a self-invoking function.

The self-invoking function only runs once.
It sets the counter to zero (0), and returns a function expression.

This way add becomes a function. The "wonderful" part is that it can access
the counter in the parent scope.

This is called a JavaScript closure. It makes it possible for a function
to have "private" variables.

The counter is protected by the scope of the anonymous function, and can only be changed using the add function.

A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after
the parent function has closed. */
